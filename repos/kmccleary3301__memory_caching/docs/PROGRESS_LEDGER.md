# Progress Ledger

Date: 2026-03-06

## Checklist interpretation

- Historical weighted-completion percentages in this repository refer to an internal engineering checklist.
- They do not imply scientific reproduction completeness.

## Historical engineering checklist closeout

- Closed engineering checklist status: **complete**
- Historical weighted completion at closeout: **100.00%**

## Current scientific status

- Scientific reproduction status: **substantially unblocked, but not full paper parity**
- Public-package readiness status: **substantially improved, but not yet release-complete**

## Current weighted progress snapshot

- Weighting model:
  - `P0` critical faithfulness blockers: `30%`
  - `P1` trust-surface correction: `20%`
  - `P2` release/package realism: `30%`
  - `P3` scientific-faithfulness unblockers: `20%`
- Phase progress:
  - `P0`: `100.0%` `[##############################]`
  - `P1`: `100.0%` `[##############################]`
  - `P2`: `96.0%` `[#############################-]`
  - `P3`: `72.0%` `[######################--------]`
- Overall planner-derived completion:
  - `93.2%` `[############################--]`

## Latest milestone update (2026-03-06)

- The current planner-derived post-critique tranche crossed the `>90%` overall completion threshold.
- Scientific model-backed benchmark execution completed for NIAH, MQAR, LongBench, and retrieval using truthful manifests and non-smoke targets.
- Historical pre-model-backed `full_dataset` artifacts were isolated from the active scientific artifact root so aggregate scientific reports are no longer mixed with legacy rule-based outputs.
- Final validation checks passed:
  - `claim_evidence_lint: PASS`
  - `engineering_release_gate_v1: PASS`
  - `scientific_release_gate_v1: PASS`
  - `install_smoke: PASS`
  - `phase2.sh: PASS`
  - `pytest: 119 passed`

## Remaining blocked work

- literal paper-parity work remains outstanding, especially missing paper baselines such as `Log-Linear++`
- final public-release polish remains outstanding, mainly release-boundary decisions such as license/publication closeout
- a green scientific gate still does not imply full paper-table parity

## Log-linear follow-on status (2026-03-08)

- `LogLinearPP` now exists as a real baseline preset/config family.
- original `LogLinearAttention` now has dense, recurrent, and correctness-first chunked reference paths in-package.
- the next milestone is pilot-scale model-backed evidence for the new log-linear families.
