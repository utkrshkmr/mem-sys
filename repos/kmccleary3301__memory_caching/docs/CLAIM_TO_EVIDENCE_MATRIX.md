# Claim to Evidence Matrix

This matrix separates mechanism claims from engineering-scaffold claims and blocked scientific claims.

No claim in this document should use `paper-scale`, `parity`, or `full-dataset` as scientific evidence unless the backing artifact records:

- `adapter_type="model_backed"`
- non-smoke targets
- a model family that actually uses Memory Caching

## Run-generated claims (CI or local scripts)

| claim | evidence_type | location |
|---|---|---|
| Smoke benchmark trend/parity/stat/checksum reports can be generated reproducibly | generated_evidence_by_scripts | `scripts/checks/bench_smoke.sh`, `scripts/reports/benchmark_trend.py`, `scripts/reports/parity_dashboard.py`, `scripts/reports/stat_summary.py`, `scripts/reports/artifact_checksums.py` |

| Full-dataset scaffold execution path is scripted with subset safety guardrails | generated_evidence_by_script | `scripts/checks/paper_scale_execution.sh` |
| Scientific train manifests are validated for model family, MC truthfulness, tokenizer metadata, config path, and training-data provenance | generated_evidence_by_scripts | `src/memory_caching/scientific_manifest.py`, `scripts/checks/scientific_manifest_lint.py`, `artifacts/train_manifest.json` |
| Scientific benchmark manifests require `adapter_type=model_backed` and explicit `model_info` metadata | generated_evidence_by_scripts | `src/memory_caching/scientific_manifest.py`, `scripts/checks/scientific_manifest_lint.py`, `outputs/benchmarks/full_dataset/*/manifest.json` |

| Log-linear pilot runner can generate model-backed pilot benchmark artifacts for baseline/reference families | generated_evidence_by_scripts | `scripts/checks/loglinear_pilot.sh`, `scripts/reports/loglinear_pilot_report.py`, `outputs/reports/loglinear_pilot_report.json` |

## Blocked scientific claims

| blocked_claim | why_blocked | required_evidence_to_unblock |
|---|---|---|
| Full paper-metric parity across all tables/tasks | `LogLinearPP` baseline presence is no longer the blocker, but baseline evaluation evidence and paper-scale model-backed runs are not complete | Evaluate `LogLinearPP` + complete paper-scale model-backed eval runs |
| Throughput parity against paper systems | No dedicated normalized perf harness | Hardware-normalized benchmark harness and published runs |
| Exact parity with unpublished author internals | Author reference implementation unavailable | Author release/confirmation or exact official code comparison |
| Scientific release status for current scaffold outputs | Current benchmark evidence is dominated by rule-based adapters and smoke targets | Model-backed metrics, non-smoke targets, and Memory-Caching model manifests |
| Table-level parity claims without complete baseline evidence | `LogLinearPP` exists as a baseline preset/config family, but evaluation evidence remains open | Implement and evaluate the missing baseline evidence set |
| LogLinearPP empirical parity | Baseline implementation presence is not the same thing as empirical benchmark evidence | Model-backed pilot evidence first, then paper-scale benchmark evidence |
