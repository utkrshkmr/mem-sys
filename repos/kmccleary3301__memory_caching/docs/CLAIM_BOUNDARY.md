# Claim Boundary

## Allowed claims (current)

- Mechanism-level implementation completeness for supported modules.
- Deterministic benchmark harness behavior for synthetic suites.
- Deterministic benchmark harness behavior for dataset-file ingestion mode.
- Evidence artifact generation and schema conformance.
- Rule-based benchmark adapters are explicitly marked as compatibility adapters (not model-backed evaluation).

## Blocked claims (until further evidence)

- Paper-metric parity across all benchmarks.
- Throughput parity with paper infrastructure.
- Exact implementation equivalence with unpublished author training internals.
- `LogLinearPP` parity claims beyond baseline presence (until benchmark/evaluation evidence exists).
- Original `LogLinearAttention` claims (until that separate mechanism family is implemented and validated).
