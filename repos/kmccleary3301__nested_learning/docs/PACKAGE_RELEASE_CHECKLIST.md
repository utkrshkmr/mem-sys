- [ ] wheel install smoke works outside repo tree:
  - [ ] `python -m venv /tmp/nl-wheel`
  - [ ] `pip install dist/*.whl`
  - [ ] `python -m nested_learning --help`
  - [ ] `python -m nested_learning doctor --json`
  - [ ] `python -m nested_learning smoke --config-name pilot_smoke --device cpu --batch-size 1 --seq-len 8`
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated with:
  - [ ] release highlights
  - [ ] breaking changes (or explicit “none”)
- [ ] `README.md` reflects current compatibility tiers and install guidance.
