# Skills

Add reusable workflows as:

```text
.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Each skill should be self-contained and task-specific.
Include YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`.
If a skill needs reference files, place them in a `references/` subdirectory inside the skill folder.
Symlinks to public repo docs are allowed when the referenced file is already tracked in this repository.

Do not add a `README.md` inside individual skill directories; the canonical entry point is `SKILL.md`.
