## Report Bugs

If you run into any weird behavior while using `fla`, feel free to open a new [issue](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/issues)! Please run a **search before opening** a new issue, to make sure that someone else hasn't already reported or solved the bug you've found.

Any issue you open should include:

- A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
- A clear explanation of what the issue is.

## Ask Questions

Please ask questions in [issues](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/issues) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vDaJTmKNcS). Check [FAQs.md](FAQs.md) first for common questions.

## Core Principles

Read these before changing any kernel — they are the bar every PR is held to.

1. **Match the reference numerically.** Every optimized kernel must agree with its naive reference within `assert_close` tolerance. Pure refactors and other non-computational changes (rewrites, fused paths, autotune tweaks) must leave outputs **and gradients** unchanged — verify before vs. after, don't assume.
2. **Find the root cause before patching.** Don't land band-aid fixes. If a change appears to help but you can't explain why, keep digging.
3. **Reuse over duplication.** Check `fla/ops/common/` and existing operators before writing new kernels; unify shared code paths instead of copying per-operator variants.
4. **Audit every callsite when touching shared code.** Renaming a symbol, changing a config field, or editing a common kernel/component means updating *all* of its uses in one pass — not one spot at a time. Changes in `fla/ops/` or `fla/modules/` ripple up to `fla/layers/` and `fla/models/`: check those consumers and decide explicitly whether the public interface needs to change. See [Triton Kernels](#triton-kernels) for the kernel-level checklist.
5. **Protect battle-tested paths; keep diffs minimal.** Changes to converged kernels or public APIs can silently break user code or checkpoints. Change only what the fix or feature needs, plus light incidental cleanups — don't revert or rewrite working code just because it could be cleaner (note it as optional in review instead). Flag risky changes, and when in doubt, ask.

## Setup Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.10
- PyTorch >= 2.7.0
- A GPU with Triton support (NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel)

### Setup

1. Fork flash-linear-attention ([fork](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/fork)) on GitHub and clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<your username>/flash-linear-attention.git
    cd flash-linear-attention

    git remote add upstream git@github.com:fla-org/flash-linear-attention.git
    ```

2. Install in development mode with a backend extra (`cuda` / `rocm` / `xpu` / `npu` / `cpu`):

    ```bash
    pip install -e '.[cuda,test]'
    ```

    For non-CUDA backends, install the matching `torch` + `triton` flavor from the PyTorch index first (see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)), then run the editable install with the matching extra (e.g. `.[rocm,test]`).

    > [!TIP]
    > If the install fails, double-check that your PyTorch version matches your local CUDA toolkit and that `nvcc` is available in your `PATH`.

3. Setup the [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) hooks:

    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
    ```

### Lint Check

To check the linting, run:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Test Locally

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Code Style

### Copyright Header

Every source file should begin with the following header:

```python
# Copyright (c) 2023-2026, Songlin Yang, Yu Zhang, Zhiyuan Li
#
# This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the
# LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
# For a list of all contributors, visit:
#   https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/graphs/contributors
```

A CI workflow (`check-header.yml`) enforces this automatically.

### Formatting and Linting

We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) for formatting. Pre-commit hooks run both automatically.

Key rules:
- **Max line length**: 127 characters
- **Target Python version**: 3.10+
- **Import sorting**: `isort`-compatible via Ruff (`fla` as first-party)
- **Type hints**: Use modern syntax (`X | None` instead of `Optional[X]`, `list[str]` instead of `List[str]`)
- Use `TYPE_CHECKING` for imports only needed at type-check time
- **Line width**: use the full 127 characters before reaching for a line break — a statement that fits on one line stays on one line.
- **Calls**: prefer keyword arguments over positional ones. A call that fits within the limit stays on one line; a call that overflows breaks with a hanging indent, **one keyword argument per line** — never several.
- **Parameter order**: keep related parameters adjacent, and pass keyword arguments at call sites in the same order they appear in the signature.

### Docstrings and Comments

Comments and docstrings are hints for other readers, not a chain of thought. Give the reader what the code cannot say for itself, in as few words as possible — correct, simple, and with no narration of your reasoning.

Write docstrings at a high level: say what the function or test does and the contract it guarantees, and let the code speak for its own mechanics. A docstring that only restates the body is better left unwritten.

Use a two-line hanging format for `Args:` / `Returns:` entries: a `name (type, Optional):` header line, then the description and `Default:` on the next indented line(s).

```python
Args:
    hidden_size (int, Optional):
        The hidden size of the input. Default: 2048.
    use_output_gate (bool, Optional):
        Whether to apply a gated RMSNorm on the attention output. Default: `False`.
```

Capitalize `Optional` (not `optional`), put the default as `Default: <value>` (not "Defaults to ..."), and wrap `True` / `False` / `None` in backticks. See `fla/layers/gla.py::GatedLinearAttention` for the canonical example.

Keep inline comments restrained, especially in Triton kernels: shape annotations (e.g. `# [BL, BD]`) plus at most a one-line "why" for genuinely non-obvious tricks. Avoid multi-line derivations and narration that just restates the next line — math derivations belong in the operator's `README.md`, the PR description, or a single pointer, not inline.

Put explanatory comments on their own line **above** the code they describe, not trailing it — write `# why` on the line above `x = f()`, not `x = f()  # why`. Start the comment text with a lowercase letter (`# guard against overflow`, not `# Guard against overflow`), and wrap a multi-line comment at clause boundaries like other prose. Reserve inline trailing comments for terse shape / type annotations like `# [BL, BD]`.

Comments and docstrings must not go stale: when a change makes one factually wrong — a renamed symbol, a changed default, a removed code path — update or delete it in the same commit. An outdated comment is worse than none. If you can't tell whether a comment is still true, keep it and say so in the PR description; don't delete a "why" comment you merely can't verify. Fixing stale content means fixing the words, not reformatting the surrounding comment or docstring style.

Beyond narration that restates the next line, these comment patterns are banned:

- **Banner blocks** (`##### ... #####`): section boundaries should be visible from the code structure; use a blank line.
- **Commented-out code**: delete it — git has the history. Exception: commented-out *configurations* deliberately kept as documented alternatives (e.g. known-good autotune configs for a future dtype) may stay if a one-line comment says why they are kept.
- **Personal asides** (`# XY: remove this?`): a name in a comment is not an owner. Convert it to a TODO with an anchor, or delete it.
- **Anchorless TODOs**: a TODO must name when it can be acted on — a link to a tracking issue (this repo or upstream), a version bound (`TODO: drop once we require triton>=3.5`), or an externally checkable event. This applies to TODOs in docstrings too; see `fla/ops/utils/op.py::safe_dot` for the pattern.

Never treated as excess comments: the license header required by `scripts/check_header.py`, a one-line attribution with a URL for adapted code, shape/dtype annotations, and `NOTE:` / `WARNING:` prefixes on a genuine "why" comment.

### Prose and Markdown

Don't hard-wrap prose at an arbitrary short column — this covers Markdown files, Python docstrings (including `Args:` / `Returns:` descriptions), and comment paragraphs. Either keep a paragraph on a single line, or break **only at sentence or clause boundaries** (after a `.`, `,`, `;`, or `—`), never mid-clause. In Python files the 127-character limit still applies, so wrap a docstring or comment at a clause boundary before it reaches the limit. Format Markdown tables with aligned columns so the `|` separators line up; table rows are exempt from the line limit.

### Naming Conventions

| Entity          | Convention         | Example                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Classes         | PascalCase         | `GatedDeltaNet`, `LinearAttention`        |
| Functions       | snake_case         | `chunk_delta_rule`, `fused_recurrent_gla` |
| Constants       | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE   | `FLA_CI_ENV`, `SUPPORTS_AUTOTUNE_CACHE`   |
| Private helpers | Leading underscore | `_guarded_empty`, `_is_called_from_fla`   |

### Triton Kernels

- Kernel functions use `@triton.jit` with `do_not_specialize=['T']` for the sequence-length argument.
- Use `tl.constexpr` for compile-time constants (block sizes, flags like `USE_INITIAL_STATE`).
- Write block accesses as explicit offset vectors (`offset + tl.arange`) with
  plain `tl.load` / `tl.store`. Masked loads must cover every dimension that
  can overrun at any call site, with `other=` where masked lanes matter; assert
  any divisibility you rely on. Do not use `tl.make_block_ptr` / `tl.advance`:
  deprecated upstream and removed in triton main. (`backends/triton_ascend/` is
  exempt — triton-ascend still requires block pointers.)
- `tl.make_tensor_descriptor` (TMA) is an opt-in optimization for hot-path tiles, not a default substitute for block access. Availability is `IS_TMA_SUPPORTED` in `fla/utils/_device.py`, which covers Nvidia Hopper and newer plus AMD gfx1250, and is gated behind `FLA_USE_TMA=1` on every backend. The AMD side is an arch allowlist rather than a version floor — gfx942 and gfx950 have no such lowering — so extend `IS_AMD_TMA_ARCH` explicitly when another arch gains it, and don't assume a higher `gfx` number implies support. Note that no CI runner currently has a TMA-capable AMD arch, so that path is only exercised by local runs.
- Descriptors require 16-byte-aligned bases and stride multiples, a stride-1 innermost dim, no transposed blocks, and a registered allocator for device-side descriptors. Nothing verifies the alignment for you and a violation faults at launch rather than failing to compile, so derive a guard on the host from the dtype and the shapes the op is actually tested at, and fall back to the plain-pointer path when it fails — a head dim of `K=60` in fp16, as KDA is tested at, is 120 bytes per row and cannot back a descriptor. Descriptor stores are also asynchronous, so a kernel must never read back a location it just stored through a descriptor.
- Use TMA when a per-kernel benchmark in the PR shows it pays off, behind a `USE_TMA: tl.constexpr` flag that keeps the plain-pointer path intact, as in `fla/ops/utils/solve_tril.py`. A benchmark on one vendor does not carry over to the other: the descriptor path in `solve_tril` was tuned on Hopper and has not been measured on gfx1250.
- Treat program IDs and grid-derived indices as potentially narrow integers.
  Cast them to `tl.int64` before multiplying by sizes, strides, or sequence
  offsets. This is especially important for non-first grid dimensions on NVIDIA
  and for non-NVIDIA backends where every grid dimension may be narrow.
- Keep all tensor address arithmetic in `tl.int64`: block bases, varlen offsets,
  strides, sequence positions, and element offsets must not rely on `int16` or
  `int32` overflow behavior.
- Gate autotune configs with `autotune_cache_kwargs` for cache support.
- Kernel naming: `<op>_fwd_kernel_<suffix>` / `<op>_bwd_kernel_<suffix>`.
- When renaming a symbol or adding/moving a parameter, sweep **every** site in one pass: the tensor, its `b_*` value, the `p_*` block pointer, comments, and — across the forward/backward kernels, host wrappers, and autograd `Function` — every signature, launch, return tuple, and `save_for_backward`/`saved_tensors` list.

### PyTorch Operators

- Wrap public-facing ops with the `@input_guard` decorator to ensure tensor contiguity.
- Use `@autocast_custom_fwd` / `@autocast_custom_bwd` for mixed-precision support.
- Provide a reference (naive) implementation in `naive.py` for testing.

## Adding a New Operator

When adding a new operator under `fla/ops/<op_name>/`:

1. **Create the directory** with an `__init__.py` that exports the public API.
2. **Write a naive implementation** (`naive.py`) in pure PyTorch. This serves as the ground-truth reference for testing.
3. **Implement the optimized kernel(s)** in `chunk.py`, `parallel.py`, and/or `fused_recurrent.py`.
4. **Reuse shared kernels** from `fla/ops/common/` where possible (e.g., `chunk_fwd_o`, `chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd_h`).
5. **Add tests** in `tests/ops/test_<op_name>.py` (see [Testing](#testing) below).
6. **(Optional)** Add a `README.md` with mathematical derivations.

## Adding a New Model

Each model lives under `fla/models/<model_name>/` with:

- `configuration_<model_name>.py` — Config class extending `PretrainedConfig`
- `modeling_<model_name>.py` — Model, PreTrainedModel, and ForCausalLM classes
- `__init__.py` — Auto-registration with `transformers`

Register your model in `fla/models/__init__.py` for auto-discovery.

## Testing

Every change to `fla/ops/` or `fla/modules/` must add or update the matching test under `tests/`, and a new operator must ship with a naive reference to compare against. Correctness is checked by **strict numerical comparison** against that reference — forward outputs *and* gradients — so a change that lacks a test, or only checks the forward pass, is not complete.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/ops/test_delta.py

# Run a specific test
pytest tests/ops/test_delta.py::test_chunk -v
```

### Writing Tests

Tests compare optimized (Triton) implementations against reference (naive/recurrent) implementations. Follow this pattern:

```python
import pytest
import torch

from fla.ops.your_op import chunk_your_op, fused_recurrent_your_op
from fla.utils import assert_close, device, device_platform


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    ('B', 'T', 'H', 'D', 'dtype'),
    [
        pytest.param(*test, id="B{}-T{}-H{}-D{}-{}".format(*test))
        for test in [
            (1, 63, 1, 64, torch.float16),
            (2, 1000, 4, 128, torch.float16),
        ]
    ],
)
def test_chunk(B: int, T: int, H: int, D: int, dtype: torch.dtype):
    torch.manual_seed(42)
    q = torch.randn(B, T, H, D, dtype=dtype).to(device).requires_grad_(True)
    k = torch.randn(B, T, H, D, dtype=dtype).to(device).requires_grad_(True)
    v = torch.randn(B, T, H, D, dtype=dtype).to(device).requires_grad_(True)
    do = torch.rand_like(v)

    # Triton implementation
    tri = chunk_your_op(q.clone(), k.clone(), v.clone())
    (tri * do).sum().backward()
    tri_dq, tri_dk, tri_dv = q.grad, k.grad, v.grad
    q.grad = k.grad = v.grad = None

    # Reference implementation
    ref = fused_recurrent_your_op(q.clone(), k.clone(), v.clone())
    (ref * do).sum().backward()
    ref_dq, ref_dk, ref_dv = q.grad, k.grad, v.grad

    assert_close('o', ref, tri, 0.006)
    assert_close('dq', ref_dq, tri_dq, 0.006)
    assert_close('dk', ref_dk, tri_dk, 0.006)
    assert_close('dv', ref_dv, tri_dv, 0.006)
```

Key guidelines:

- **Always use `torch.manual_seed(42)`** for reproducibility.
- **Use `assert_close`** from `fla.utils` for numerical comparison with relative tolerance.
- **Use `device` from `fla.utils`** for device-agnostic tests.
- **Parametrize** with diverse shapes including non-power-of-2 sequence lengths (e.g., 63, 100, 2000).
- **Skip unsupported platforms** with `@pytest.mark.skipif(device_platform == 'intel', ...)` when needed.
- **Include test IDs** in parametrize for readable output.

**Naming and structure.** Name the file `tests/ops/test_<op>.py`, and name each test after the implementation entry point it exercises — `test_chunk`, `test_fused_recurrent`, `test_parallel` — mirroring the functions in `fla/ops/<op>/`. Distinguish a genuinely different code path with a short suffix (`test_chunk_varlen`, `test_fused_recurrent_state_v_first`). Prefer adding a new shape, dtype, or flag as a `@parametrize` case on an existing test rather than writing a new function; only add a new function when the path or purpose is clearly different — varlen vs. dense, a specific feature flag, or a separate entry point. See `tests/ops/test_gla.py` and `tests/ops/test_gdn.py` for the pattern.

### NaN Memory Poisoning

The test suite (`conftest.py`) automatically replaces `torch.empty` with NaN-filled tensors for `tests/ops/` and `tests/modules/`. This catches bugs where uninitialized memory is accidentally used. You don't need to do anything special — just be aware that your kernels must fully initialize all output tensors.

## Benchmarking

Any change that can affect performance — a new or rewritten kernel in `fla/ops/` or `fla/modules/`, an autotune or backend tweak — should come with before/after numbers in the PR, measured on the same hardware and workload. `[Perf]` PRs must include them.

Benchmark only against a **green test gate**. A kernel that runs faster but fails its `tests/ops/test_<op>.py` (forward, backward, and NaN-poisoned init) is not an improvement, so confirm correctness first — see [Testing](#testing).

**Op microbenchmark** — times forward and forward+backward across a shape sweep, and compares against a git ref (it builds a throwaway worktree, so your working tree is untouched):

```bash
python -m benchmarks.ops.run --op chunk_gla --base main   # one op vs. main
python -m benchmarks.ops.run --list                       # registered ops
```

New ops are registered in `benchmarks/ops/registry.py`.

**Correctness-gated driver** — runs the op's pytest as a frozen gate, then benchmarks, and refuses to report a speedup on a red gate. Use it as the per-iteration command when optimizing a kernel; the `fla-optimization-loop` agent skill drives the full loop:

```bash
python -m benchmarks.ops.verify --op chunk_gla --base main
```

**Model-level throughput and generation:**

```bash
python benchmarks/benchmark_training_throughput.py --name kda --batch_size 2 --seq_len 8192 [--varlen]
python benchmarks/benchmark_generation.py --name kda
```

For profiling (Nsight Compute, hot-instruction analysis), see the `fla-nvidia-performance` agent skill. Report throughput (tokens/s or iters/s) and, when relevant, peak memory, and flag any shape or backend that regressed and why.

## Submit Pull Requests

Once your change is implemented, tested, and (if it touches performance) benchmarked, open a pull request against `main`.

> [!NOTE]
> Please include tests with every pull request if applicable!

- **Keep the scope focused**: one PR should do one thing. If you have multiple unrelated changes, please split them into separate PRs.
- **Use Draft PRs**: feel free to open a draft early for design feedback or work-in-progress discussion.
- **Read `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/skills/fla-mr-readiness` first**: they cover the PR checklist, test-plan requirements, and benchmark evidence standards expected of every pull request.
- **No busywork PRs**: don't open standalone PRs for typos or isolated style tweaks; fold them into a related substantive change instead.

### Commit Message Convention

Use a prefix tag in square brackets to categorize your change. Here are some common examples:

If your change doesn't fit any of the above, `[Misc]`/`[chore]` is the safe default.

### PR Description

Lead with what changed and why, at a high level — describe the behavior or capability, not a file-by-file walkthrough. Include:

- **Summary**: the change and its motivation, stated up front. Keep it concise; reviewers read the diff for details.
- **Test plan**: how you verified it (commands run, hardware used).
- **Breaking changes** (if any): list any API changes that are not backward compatible, and describe the migration path.

See [recent PRs](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged) for examples.

### CI Pipeline

When you submit a PR, the following checks run automatically:

- **Linting** — Ruff + autopep8 via pre-commit
- **License header check** — Ensures copyright headers are present
- **GPU tests** — On NVIDIA H100/A100/4090 and Intel B580 (when available)
- **Benchmarks** — Performance regression checks; results are posted automatically as a PR comment

Add `[skip test]` to your commit message to skip GPU tests for documentation-only changes. For `[Perf]` changes, include before/after numbers in the PR — see [Benchmarking](#benchmarking).

### Review Checklist

Before submitting, please go through the following checklist:

- Code follows the project's style conventions.
- Copyright header is present on all new files.
- Changes to `fla/ops/` or `fla/modules/` add or update the matching test in `tests/`.
- Tests pass locally (`pytest tests/ops/test_<your_op>.py`).
