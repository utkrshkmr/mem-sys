An open-source toolkit for training, priming, and serving next-generation **Hybrid architectures** — models that combine Attention with State Space Models (SSMs).

Hybrid architectures include both Transformers and vanilla SSMs as special cases and modulate how each layer manages memory — some layers can retain precise recent context (Attention), while others maintain a compressed, fading summary of the unbounded past (SSMs). This makes Hybrids particularly well-suited for agentic workflows and long-running AI agents where context accumulates over long horizons but full-fidelity recall of every token at every model layer is prohibitively expensive and unnecessary.

Building Next Generation Hybrid models, however, spans the full AI software stack—from custom kernels and distributed long-context training to inference integration with frameworks like vLLM. Hybrid Model Factory wraps all of this into one toolkit:

- **Priming**: Bootstrap training of Hybrid architectures from a pre-trained Transformer's weights to preserve most of the base Transformer's knowledge without training from scratch.
- **Training**: Distill, fine-tune Hybrid models, and extend their context length (128K+) with built-in Sequence Parallelism.
- **Inference**: Deploy Hybrid Primed models through an optimized vLLM plugin.

## Primed Model Zoo

We release a model zoo of small-mid size Primed models built on top of Qwen3 to enable the community to experiment with Hybrid architectures. All our models are Primed from Qwen3 with a 50% Hybrid ratio and support up to 128K context. See [Hybrid Layer Types](#hybrid-layer-types) for details on each architecture.

To cover different modes of use we released two types of models:
- 💬 **Instruct**: Long-context instruction-tuned models
- 🧠 **Reasoning**: Long-context models with enhanced reasoning capabilities

GKA for its benchmark performance and its ability to trade inference FLOPs for accuracy at test time by adjusting the iterations of its internal Chebyshev solver, and GDN for its community adoption.

---

## Getting Started

### Inference

Production deployment is handled by a [vLLM plugin](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/v0.15.1/design/plugin_system/) that registers all our custom Hybrid architectures automatically — no vLLM fork required.

**1. Build the Docker image:**

```bash
cd vllm-inference
docker build -t vllm-hybrid .
```

**2. Serve a model:**

```bash
docker run --rm --runtime nvidia --gpus all \
  -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --ipc=host \
  vllm-hybrid \
  --model amazon/GKA-primed-HQwen3-8B-Reasoner \
  --enable-prefix-caching \
  --mamba-cache-mode align \
  --mamba-cache-dtype float32 \
  --mamba-ssm-cache-dtype float32 \
  --enable-auto-tool-choice \
  --tool-call-parser hermes \
  --reasoning-parser qwen3
```

> For Instruct models, drop `--enable-auto-tool-choice`, `--tool-call-parser`, and `--reasoning-parser`.

**3. Query the server:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "amazon/GKA-primed-HQwen3-8B-Reasoner",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is linear attention in the context of LLMs?"}
    ]
  }'
```

See [docs/Inference.md](docs/Inference.md) for full serving configuration (including pip install without Docker), flags, and [examples/vllm-inference/](examples/vllm-inference/) for one-click launch scripts for A100 and H200 GPUs. For development and debugging, models can also be loaded directly with HuggingFace Transformers — see [docs/Inference.md](docs/Inference.md#huggingface-transformers-inference).

### Training

**1. Set up the environment (Docker):**

```bash
cd training/docker
docker build -t hmf-training -f Dockerfile .
docker run --gpus all -it --rm --network host --ipc=host hmf-training
```

**2. Install and run** (inside the container):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/hybrid-model-factory.git
cd hybrid-model-factory/training
pip install -e .
hmf train examples/priming/stage2/hqwen3_8b_gka_sft_it.yaml
```

See [docs/Training.md](docs/Training.md) for detailed training documentation.

> For large datasets, we recommend pre-tokenizing your data before training. This speeds up training startup and allows data to be reused across multiple runs. See [docs/Training.md](docs/Training.md) for full tokenization options.

#### End-to-End Pipeline Scripts

For a complete end-to-end pipeline (Stage 0 → Stage 1 → Stage 2) that runs with a single script, see the hardware-specific examples:

- [`examples/training/8xA100/`](examples/training/8xA100/) — Qwen3-4B on 8× A100 (40GB)
- [`examples/training/8xH200/`](examples/training/8xH200/) — Qwen3-8B on 8× H200 (140GB)

Each directory contains a `setup_docker.sh` to build and launch the container, and a `run_pipeline.sh` that runs the full priming pipeline inside it. The pipeline configs are in [`training/examples/priming/full_pipeline/`](training/examples/priming/full_pipeline/).

All our code (including custom kernels and vLLM implementations) has been tested on A100 and H200 GPUs, with Sequence Parallel (SP) tested up to SP group size 8 for long-context training. Refer to [Tested Configurations](#tested-configurations) for a comprehensive list of hardware requirements for different model sizes and training stages.

## Priming Pipeline Overview

If you want to train a Hybrid model but have a limited compute budget, Priming lets you jumpstart training from pre-trained model weights (for example, an off-the-shelf Transformer) by replacing its Attention layers with more efficient SSM layers.

![Pipeline Overview](assets/figures/overview.png)


### Stage 0: Initialize a Hybrid architecture using the pre-trained Transformer's weights

Initializes a **fused Hybrid architecture** from a pre-trained Transformer's weights. The original Attention path (frozen teacher) and the new SSM path (trainable student) run in parallel, with shared parameters (embeddings, MLPs, layer norms) to reduce memory overhead.

![Fused Decoder Layer](assets/figures/fused.png)

```bash
cd training
hmf prime-init examples/priming/stage0/qwen3_8b_gka.yaml
```

The `hybrid_override_pattern` in the config specifies which layers become SSM layers:

| Pattern | Layer type |
|---------|------------|
| `*` | Standard Attention |
| `*DA` | Dual-path Attention (fused, for distillation) |
| `GKA` / `GKA*` | Gated KalmaNet (standard / fused) |
| `GDN` / `GDN*` | Gated DeltaNet (standard / fused) |
| `M2` / `M2*` | Mamba2 (standard / fused) |
| `BMF` / `BMF*` | B'MOJO-F (standard / fused) |
| `SWA` / `SWA*` | Sliding Window Attention (standard / fused) |

See [training/examples/priming/stage0/](training/examples/priming/stage0/) for configs for all layer types and [docs/Priming.md](docs/Priming.md) for the full configuration reference.

### Stage 1: Attention → SSM Distillation

Trains the SSM layers to match the Attention layers' behavior using MSE distillation. Attention weights are frozen; only SSM parameters are trained.

```bash
cd training
hmf train examples/priming/stage1/hqwen3_8b_gka.yaml
```

After distillation, convert the fused model to a standard Hybrid:

```bash
cd training
hmf prime-unfuse ./models/HQwen3-8B-GKA-Fused/Stage1/checkpoint-<STEPS>
```

### Stage 2: Fine-tuning

Fine-tune the Hybrid model for your target use case. Two common paths:

**Long-context continued pretraining** (extends context to 128K+ using Sequence Parallelism):

```bash
cd training

# Single node
hmf train examples/priming/stage2/hqwen3_8b_gka_long_ctx.yaml

# Multi-node (run on each node)
hmf train-multinode examples/priming/stage2/hqwen3_8b_gka_long_ctx.yaml <master_addr> <nnodes> <node_rank>
```

See [training/examples/priming/stage2/](training/examples/priming/stage2/) for all configs, [docs/Training.md](docs/Training.md) for multi-node training and DeepSpeed configuration, and [docs/SequenceParallel.md](docs/SequenceParallel.md) for details on the Sequence Parallelism implementation.


**Supervised fine-tuning (SFT):**

```bash
cd training

# Single node
hmf train examples/priming/stage2/hqwen3_8b_gka_sft_it.yaml

# Multi-node (run on each node)
hmf train-multinode examples/priming/stage2/hqwen3_8b_gka_sft_it.yaml <master_addr> <nnodes> <node_rank>
```

See [training/examples/priming/stage2/](training/examples/priming/stage2/) for all configs and [docs/Training.md](docs/Training.md) for multi-node training, Sequence Parallelism, and DeepSpeed configuration.

### Training-Free Context Length Extension

Hybrid models also support training-free context extension up to 2-4× their native size via experimental Hybrid state composition (e.g. [PICASO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17605)). See [docs/StateComposition.md](docs/StateComposition.md) for usage.

## Supported Architectures

### Base Models

| Model Family | Supported Versions |
|--------------|--------------------|
| Qwen | Qwen3, Qwen3-MoE, Qwen2.5, Qwen3Next, Qwen3.5 |
| Llama | Llama3, Llama3.1 |
| Mistral | Ministral3 |

### Hybrid Layer Types

**Gated KalmaNet (GKA, pronounced "gee-ka")**: More expressive SSM than both Mamba2 and GDN. Inspired by Kalman filtering, it computes the state at each time-step based on the entire past rather than the instantaneous update rules used by other SSMs. This translates to strong performance on long-context and reasoning tasks. Uniquely among SSM layers, GKA supports variable compute at inference via its num_iter parameter — trade off latency vs. quality per deployment without retraining. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21016)]

**Gated DeltaNet (GDN)**: SSM with diagonal + low-rank transition dynamics. Extends Mamba2 with the Delta Update rule, improving expressiveness through gated state transitions while retaining Mamba2's efficiency. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06464)]

**Mamba2**: SSM with diagonal transition dynamics and input-dependent gating. Less expressive than GDN and GKA due to its diagonal structure, but well-supported by optimized kernels. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21060)]

**B'MOJO-F**: Hybrid layer that couples Attention (sliding window for local context) and SSMs (for global context) within the same layer. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06324)]

**Sliding Window Attention (SWA)**: Standard attention limited to a fixed window (e.g., 512 tokens). Useful as a baseline for comparing exact-but-bounded memory (SWA) against approximate-but-unbounded memory (SSMs).

For guidance on choosing the right layer type and hybridization ratio for your use case, see [docs/LayerSelection.md](docs/LayerSelection.md).

## Performance

Results on our Primed Hybrid 8B and 32B models using different layer types. All models use a 50% Hybrid ratio (half of Attention layers replaced with SSM). 
Our Primed Hybrid models closely match Transformer (Qwen3) performance while achieving up to 2× faster inference (see [below](#inference-efficiency)).

### Inference Efficiency

Sustained decode throughput (tokens/s) and mean TTFT on 8× H200 GPUs (TP=8), measured during pure decode with a saturated KV cache. Benchmarked with random data (without prefix-caching). GKA's `num_iter` controls solver iterations at inference — lower values trade a small amount of accuracy for faster speed. See the full [Inference guide](docs/Inference.md#performance-benchmarks) for methodology, TP×DP configurations, and reproducing instructions.
