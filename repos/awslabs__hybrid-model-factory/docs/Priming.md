## Priming: Hybrid Models from Pre-trained Models

Priming uses a pre-trained Transformer's weights as an initial condition to bootstrap a new Hybrid architecture. The resulting model is its own artifact — not a modified Transformer, but a purpose-built Hybrid realization that inherits the base model's knowledge while gaining the efficiency benefits of State-Space Model (SSM) layers: smaller KV cache, faster long-context inference, and lower memory usage.

This guide walks through the full Priming pipeline: from architecture conversion to distillation to fine-tuning. It covers different base models (e.g. Qwen3, Qwen3-MoE, Qwen2.5, Llama3, Ministral3) and SSM layers (e.g., Gated KalmaNet, Gated DeltaNet, Mamba2, B'MOJO-F).

## Why Prime Models?

Training a strong Hybrid model from scratch requires massive compute and energy consumption.
Priming saves time and energy by starting from an existing Transformer checkpoint and training the new SSM layers to preserve the model's end-to-end quality despite operating with a different, more efficient memory hierarchy.

The name draws from *priming* in psychology — where prior exposure shapes subsequent learning. Here, a Transformer's pre-trained weights prime the Hybrid model, accelerating its training and preserving knowledge that would otherwise require learning from scratch.

## Pipeline Overview

Priming follows a three-stage recipe:
![Pipeline Overview](../assets/figures/overview.png)

| Stage | What it does | Trainable parameters |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Stage 0** | Initialize a Hybrid architecture using the pre-trained Transformer's weights; SSM layers are seeded from their corresponding Attention layers | N/A (no training) |
| **Stage 1** | Distills Attention outputs into SSM layers using MSE loss | SSM parameters only |
| **Stage 2** | Fine-tunes the Hybrid model for your target use case (long-context, SFT, reasoning, etc.) | Configurable (typically SSM + Attention + norms) |

---

## Stage 0: Transformer → Hybrid Conversion

Stage 0 initializes a **fused Hybrid architecture** from a pretrained Transformer. In this architecture, each replaced layer contains both the original Attention path and the new SSM path running in parallel:

- The **Attention path** (teacher) is frozen and provides supervisory signal during Stage 1.
- The **SSM path** (student) is the trainable component.

Shared parameters (embeddings, MLPs, layer norms, LM head) are inherited directly from the base Transformer, reducing memory overhead compared to loading separate teacher and student models.

![Fused Decoder Layer](../assets/figures/fused.png)

In the figure above, Attention Blocks (purple) process both streams through Attention, providing the supervisory signal. Hybrid Blocks (yellow) route each stream through its native component—the Attention stream through the Attention mixer, and the SSM stream through the SSM mixer (e.g., GKA)—so the student can learn from the teacher's representations via MSE loss (green arrows).

### SSM Weight Initialization

When replacing an Attention layer with an SSM layer, the Attention projection weights are transferred to initialize the SSM parameters. For example, for [GKA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21016) and [GDN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06464), the mapping is:

| Attention parameter | SSM parameter |
|-------------------|---------------|
| W_Q (query projection) | q_proj |
| W_K (key projection) | k_proj |
| W_V (value projection) | v_proj |
| W_O (output projection) | o_proj |
| 0.5 * (W_O^T + repeat_interleave(W_V)) | g_proj (gate) |

This initialization is motivated by the mathematical relationship between Attention and SSMs: removing the Softmax from Attention yields a recurrence that maps directly to the SSM formulation. Notably, we initialize gate projections (z for Mamba2) as a blend of the transposed output projection and the (GQA-expanded) value projection, which we found empirically to improve upon random initialization used in prior works [The Mamba in the Llama](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15237).

All other SSM-specific parameters (e.g., conv weights) are initialized randomly. 
See [hybrid_layer_init.py](../training/src/hmf/priming/hybrid_layer_init.py) for the full initialization logic for each layer type.

### Configuration

Create a YAML config specifying the base model, the layer pattern, and any layer-specific parameters:

```yaml
# Base model to convert
base_model_name_or_path: Qwen/Qwen3-8B

# Output directory for the converted model
output_dir: ./models/HQwen3-8B-GKA-Fused

# Layer pattern: specifies the type of each decoder layer (see Layer Pattern Syntax below)
hybrid_override_pattern: "*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-..."

# Layer-specific parameters (varies by layer type)
gka:
  use_forgetting_gate: true
  solver_type: "chebyshev"
  # ... see Layer Configuration Reference below
```

See [examples/priming/stage0/](../training/examples/priming/stage0/) for complete configs for all supported layer types.

### Layer Pattern Syntax

The `hybrid_override_pattern` string specifies the layer type for each decoder layer, separated by hyphens (`-`). The number of entries must match the number of decoder layers in the base model.

**For Stage 0/1 (fused architecture):**

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*` | Standard Attention (kept as-is) |
| `*DA` | Dual-path Attention (fused) |
| `GKA*` | Fused GKA + Attention |
| `GDN*` | Fused GDN + Attention |
| `M2*` | Fused Mamba2 + Attention |
| `BMF*` | Fused B'MOJO-F + Attention |
| `SWA*` | Fused SWA + Attention |
| `GDN>GKA` | Fused GDN → GKA (SSM-to-SSM distillation) |

**For Stage 2 (standard/unfused architecture):**

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*` | Standard Attention |
| `GKA` | Gated KalmaNet |
| `GDN` | Gated DeltaNet |
| `M2` | Mamba2 |
| `BMF` | B'MOJO-F |
| `SWA` | Sliding Window Attention |

**Example** — 36-layer model, 50% Hybrid ratio, fused (Stage 0/1):
```
*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*-*DA-GKA*
```

**Example** — same model, unfused (Stage 2):
```
*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA-*-GKA
```

**Hybrid ratio** is the fraction of Attention layers replaced with SSM layers. A 50% ratio on a 36-layer model means 18 Attention + 18 SSM layers. However, not all Attention layers are equally suited for replacement by SSMs. Consequently, we develop a scoring algorithm to identify which layers are "best" for priming. For more details on how we perform layer selection, see [docs/LayerSelection.md](LayerSelection.md).

### Running Stage 0

```bash
cd training
hmf prime-init examples/priming/stage0/qwen3_8b_gka.yaml
```

The script will:
1. Load the base Transformer model
2. Construct the fused Hybrid architecture with the specified layer pattern
3. Transfer shared weights (embeddings, MLPs, layer norms, LM head) from the base model
4. Initialize SSM layers using the Attention weight mapping described above
5. Save the fused model and tokenizer to `output_dir`

---

## Stage 1: Attention → SSM Distillation

Stage 1 trains the SSM layers to match the Attention layers' behavior using **MSE distillation**. Using the fused architecture from Stage 0, both paths process the same input in parallel. The Attention weights are **frozen**, i.e., only the SSM-specific parameters are trained.

By default (`hybrid_distill_pre_lm_head: true`), the MSE loss is applied on the **final hidden states before the LM head**, comparing the SSM path's output to the Attention path's output after all decoder layers:

```
L = ||h_SSM - h_Attention||²     (computed after the final layer norm, before the LM head)
```

This end-to-end objective gives the SSM layers freedom to develop their own internal representations, i.e., they don't need to match the teacher at every layer, only at the final output.

Optionally, **layerwise MSE** can be enabled via `hybrid_lw_distill_target` to add per-layer supervision at different granularities:

| `hybrid_lw_distill_target` | What it matches per layer |
|---|---|
| `none` (default) | No per-layer loss—only the pre-LM-head loss is used |
| `mixer` | Sequence mixer outputs (Attention vs SSM mixer) |
| `decoder` | Full decoder layer outputs (after mixer + MLP) |
| `residuals` | Both residual contributions (mixer output + MLP output) |
| `all` | All of the above combined |

These can be combined with `hybrid_distill_pre_lm_head: true` for both per-layer and end-to-end supervision simultaneously.

### Configuration

```yaml
### Model ###
model_name_or_path: ./models/HQwen3-8B-GKA-Fused

### Distillation ###
stage: hkd                        # Specify our distillation trainer for fused Hybrid models
hybrid_lw_distill_target: none
hybrid_distill_pre_lm_head: true  # Apply MSE on final hidden states (before LM head)
hybrid_learnable_params: gka      # Train only SSM parameters (use the layer type name)

### Training ###
per_device_train_batch_size: 1
gradient_accumulation_steps: 4
learning_rate: 1.0e-4
lr_scheduler_type: constant_with_warmup
warmup_steps: 720
max_steps: 19000

### Output ###
output_dir: ./models/HQwen3-8B-GKA-Fused/Stage1
```

Key parameters:
- `stage: hkd` — enables the hybrid knowledge distillation training mode
- `hybrid_learnable_params` — comma-separated list of parameter name substrings to train (e.g., `gka`, `mamba`, `gdn`). All other parameters are frozen.
- `hybrid_distill_pre_lm_head: true` — applies MSE loss on the final hidden states before the LM head
- `hybrid_lw_distill_target` — which intermediate outputs to align. Options: `none`, `decoder`, `mixer`, `residuals`, `all`

See [examples/priming/stage1/](../training/examples/priming/stage1/) for complete configs.

### Running Stage 1

Single node:
```bash
cd training
hmf train examples/priming/stage1/hqwen3_8b_gka.yaml
```

Multi-node (run on each node):
```bash
cd training
hmf train-multinode examples/priming/stage1/hqwen3_8b_gka.yaml <master_addr> <nnodes> <node_rank>
```

### Converting Fused to Standard (Unfusing)

After distillation, convert the fused model to a standard Hybrid model by removing the parallel Attention paths:

```bash
cd training
hmf prime-unfuse ./models/HQwen3-8B-GKA-Fused/Stage1/checkpoint-<STEPS>
```

Replace `<STEPS>` with the actual checkpoint step number (e.g., `checkpoint-19000`).

This performs the following conversions:
- Fused SSM layers become standard SSM layers (e.g., `GKA*` becomes `GKA`)
- Dual-path Attention becomes standard Attention (`*DA` becomes `*`)
- Fused SSM-to-SSM layers become the target SSM (e.g., `GDN>GKA` becomes `GKA`)

The output is saved to a `_unfused/` subdirectory by default. You can specify a custom output path with `--save_dir`.

---

## Stage 2: Fine-tuning

After Stage 1, the unfused Hybrid model can be fine-tuned for the target use case. Common paths include:

### Long-Context Continued Pretraining

Extends the model's effective context length (e.g., to 128K) using continued pretraining on long-context data with Sequence Parallelism:

```yaml
### Model ###
model_name_or_path: ./models/HQwen3-8B-GKA-Fused/Stage1/checkpoint-<STEPS>_unfused
config_overrides_json: '{"rope_theta": 5000000, "max_position_embeddings": 131072}'

### Training mode ###
stage: pt

### Train only sequence mixing params ###
hybrid_learnable_params: gka,norm,self_attn

### Context length ###
cutoff_len: 131072
sequence_parallel_size: 8         # Use SP8 for 128K context
```

```bash
cd training
hmf train examples/priming/stage2/hqwen3_8b_gka_long_ctx.yaml
```

See [docs/SequenceParallel.md](SequenceParallel.md) for details on Sequence Parallelism configuration.

### Supervised Fine-Tuning (Instruction Tuning)

Standard SFT on instruction-following data:

```yaml
### Model ###
model_name_or_path: ./models/HQwen3-8B-GKA-Fused/Stage1/checkpoint-<STEPS>_unfused

### Training mode ###
stage: sft

### Training ###
learning_rate: 5.0e-5
lr_scheduler_type: linear
warmup_ratio: 0.03
num_train_epochs: 2.0
cutoff_len: 32768
```

```bash
cd training
hmf train examples/priming/stage2/hqwen3_8b_gka_sft_it.yaml
```

### Reasoning SFT

Fine-tuning on reasoning traces (e.g., from [OpenThoughts3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04178)):

```yaml
### Model ###
model_name_or_path: ./models/HQwen3-8B-GKA-Fused/Stage1/checkpoint-<STEPS>_unfused

### Training mode ###
stage: sft

### Training ###
learning_rate: 5.0e-5
lr_scheduler_type: cosine
warmup_ratio: 0.1
num_train_epochs: 1.0
cutoff_len: 32768
drop_exceed_length_data: true
```

```bash
cd training
hmf train examples/priming/stage2/hqwen3_8b_gka_sft_reasoning.yaml
```

### Multi-Node Training (Stage 2)

For any Stage 2 config, multi-node training is supported via the launcher script:

```bash
cd training
hmf train-multinode examples/priming/stage2/your_config.yaml <master_addr> <nnodes> <node_rank>
```

See [examples/priming/stage2/](../training/examples/priming/stage2/) for all available Stage 2 configs.

## Vision-Language Models

Vision-Language models (Qwen2.5-VL, Qwen3-VL, LLaVA, etc.) follow the same Stage 0 → Stage 1 → Stage 2 recipe, with one extra step between Stage 1 and Stage 2 to wire the distilled hybrid text backbone back into the multimodal wrapper.

### How VL hybridization differs

A VL model is a multimodal wrapper (vision encoder + projector + language model) around a text Transformer. `hmf prime-init` hybridizes only the **text backbone** — the vision encoder and projector are inherited unchanged. After Stage 0, the Hybrid text backbone is saved separately to `<output_dir>/text_backbone/` so Stage 1 can run pure text-only distillation on long-context corpora (e.g., pg19) without needing image data.

### Pipeline

```bash
cd training

# Stage 0: hybridize the VL model's text backbone
hmf prime-init examples/priming/stage0/qwen2_5_vl_7b_gka.yaml
# Outputs:
#   ./models/HQwen2.5-VL-7B-GKA-Fused/                — full fused VL wrapper
#   ./models/HQwen2.5-VL-7B-GKA-Fused/text_backbone/  — text backbone only (Stage 1 input)

# Stage 1: distill on text-only data
hmf train examples/priming/stage1/hqwen2_5_vl_7b_gka.yaml
hmf prime-unfuse ./models/HQwen2.5-VL-7B-GKA-Fused/Stage1/checkpoint-<STEPS>

# Reassemble: wire the unfused hybrid text backbone back into the VL wrapper
hmf reassemble-vlm \
    Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct \
    ./models/HQwen2.5-VL-7B-GKA-Fused/Stage1/checkpoint-<STEPS>_unfused \
    ./models/HQwen2.5-VL-7B-GKA-VLM

# Stage 2: VLM SFT on the reassembled hybrid VL checkpoint
hmf train examples/priming/stage2/hqwen2_5_vl_7b_gka_sft_vlm.yaml

```

### What `hmf reassemble-vlm` does

`hmf reassemble-vlm` takes three arguments — the original VL model (provides the vision encoder + processor + structural config), the distilled hybrid text backbone (provides the GKA layers, norm, embed_tokens), and an output path — and saves a checkpoint with `model_type=hybrid_qwen2_5_vl`. This model_type is critical: it makes `AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained` rebuild the *hybrid* VL class (`HybridQwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration`) at load time so the GKA layers in the safetensors are honored. Saving with the stock VL model_type would silently drop GKA tensors at the next `from_pretrained` call.

To roundtrip correctly, the hybrid VL class must be registered with the Auto* classes — Stage 2 SFT and lmms-eval both auto-register on import via `hmf.model.hybrid_zoo.models.model_register`.

### VL-specific notes

- **Vision encoder is frozen during Stage 2.** Stage 1 distillation only trains the text backbone, so vision weights remain identical to the pretrained VL model. Set `freeze_vision_tower: true` in the Stage 2 config.
- **MRoPE collapse.** Qwen2.5-VL uses 3D/4D MRoPE position_ids, but standard Qwen2 attention (and our hybrid GKA) expects 1D positions. The hybrid VL class collapses MRoPE to its temporal axis at the language-model boundary via a forward pre-hook. This is exact for text tokens and an approximation for image tokens (height/width axes dropped). Empirically this works well enough for VLM SFT and benchmark evaluation — a future MRoPE-aware GKA layer would be the principled fix.
- **Evaluation.** Load the reassembled hybrid VL checkpoint with `AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained` after importing `hmf.model.hybrid_zoo.models.model_register` so the hybrid class is registered. For lmms-eval, register a custom `qwen2_5_vl`-style adapter that routes through `AutoModelForImageTextToText` (the upstream adapter calls `Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration` directly, which would drop GKA at load).

### Verifying GKA layers round-trip

After Stage 2 SFT, the saved checkpoint should advertise `model_type=hybrid_qwen2_5_vl` and contain GKA tensors on disk:

```bash
python -c "
import json
ROOT='./models/HQwen2.5-VL-7B-GKA-SFT-VLM'
cfg = json.load(open(f'{ROOT}/config.json'))
print('model_type:', cfg['model_type'])
print('arch:      ', cfg['architectures'])
keys = list(json.load(open(f'{ROOT}/model.safetensors.index.json'))['weight_map'])
print('GKA tensors on disk:', sum(1 for k in keys if '.gka.' in k))
"
```

A correct hybrid VL checkpoint shows `model_type: hybrid_qwen2_5_vl` and a non-zero GKA-tensor count. If GKA tensors are zero, the SFT pipeline has dropped the hybrid layers — re-check that `hmf reassemble-vlm` was used and that its output's `model_type` is `hybrid_qwen2_5_vl`.

## End-to-End Example: Priming Qwen3-8B with GKA

Here's the complete workflow to prime Qwen3-8B into a Hybrid model with GKA layers:

```bash
cd training

# Stage 0: Convert Transformer to Fused Hybrid
hmf prime-init examples/priming/stage0/qwen3_8b_gka.yaml

# Stage 1: Distill Attention to SSM
hmf train examples/priming/stage1/hqwen3_8b_gka.yaml

# Unfuse: Convert fused model to standard Hybrid
hmf prime-unfuse ./models/HQwen3-8B-GKA-Fused/Stage1/checkpoint-19000

# Stage 2: Fine-tune for your use case (pick one or both; if both, run A first)

# Option A: Extend context to 128K via continued pretraining
hmf train examples/priming/stage2/hqwen3_8b_gka_long_ctx.yaml

# Option B: Supervised fine-tuning for instruction following
# If running after A, ensure model_name_or_path in the yaml points to A's output checkpoint.
hmf train examples/priming/stage2/hqwen3_8b_gka_sft_it.yaml
```

For a Vision-Language model (Qwen2.5-VL, Qwen3-VL, LLaVA), insert a `hmf reassemble-vlm` step between Stage 1 and Stage 2. See [Vision-Language Models](#vision-language-models).
