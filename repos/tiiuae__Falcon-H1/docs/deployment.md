# Deployment

This page summarizes all the currently available tools for deploying **Falcon-H1** models.

> 💡 **Tip:** For optimal performance, always use **`torch.bfloat16`** instead of **`torch.float16`**; The recommended **`model temperature`** is **`0.1`** - higher than that, model's performance may largely drop.

---

### ✅ Supported Frameworks

**Falcon-H1** is compatible with most major inference and deployment frameworks, including:

- [Transformers](#transformers)
- [vLLM](#vllm)
- [SGLang](#sglang)
- [Apple MLX](#apple-mlx)
- [llama.cpp](#llamacpp)
- [SkyPilot](#skypilot)

## Transformers

We advise users to install Mamba-SSM from our public fork in order to include [this fix](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/pull/708). Note this is optional as we observed that the issue occurs stochastically. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/younesbelkada/mamba.git && cd mamba/ && pip install -e . --no-build-isolation
```

Check [this issue](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/pull/708) for more details.


Make sure to install `transformers` library from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
```

And use `AutoModelForCausalLM` interface, e.g.:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_id = "tiiuae/Falcon-H1-1B-Base"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
  model_id,
  torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
  device_map="auto"
)

# Perform text generation
```

## vLLM

For vLLM, simply start a server by executing the command below:

```bash
# pip install vllm
vllm serve tiiuae/Falcon-H1-1B-Instruct --tensor-parallel-size 2 --data-parallel-size 1
```

**💡 Tip:** Falcon-H1’s default `--max-model-len` is **262 144** tokens to support very long contexts, but that large window can slow throughput. Set `--max-model-len <prompt_len + output_len>` (e.g. `32768`) and cap concurrency with `--max-num-seqs <N>` (e.g. `64`) to avoid over-allocating KV-cache memory and speed up generation.

## SGLang

[SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) provides a high-performance serving runtime with native Falcon-H1 kernels.
Follow the steps below to spin up a Falcon-H1 endpoint:

```bash
# 1. Install the runtime (requires an NVIDIA GPU with FlashInfer-compatible CUDA drivers)
pip install uv
uv pip install "sglang[all]>=0.5.3"

# 2. Launch Falcon-H1 with SGLang (replace <your_token> with a Hugging Face token)
HF_TOKEN=<your_token> python -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model-path tiiuae/Falcon-H1-7B-Instruct \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 30000 \
  --trust-remote-code
```

You can now call the OpenAI-compatible endpoint exposed on `http://localhost:30000`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:30000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "tiiuae/Falcon-H1-7B-Instruct",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are Falcon-H1."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Give me a fun fact about falcons."}
    ]
  }'
```

## Apple MLX

Falcon-H1 is natively supported into Apple MLX ! Simply do:

```
pip install -U mlx-lm
```

Then run:

```
mlx_lm.generate --model tiiuae/Falcon-H1-0.5B-Instruct --prompt "Implement bubble sort from scratch" --max-tokens 100 --temp 0.7
```

## llama.cpp

Falcon-H1 is natively supported into `llama.cpp` !

All official GGUF files can be found on [our official Hugging Face collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/tiiuae/falcon-h1-6819f2795bc406da60fab8df).

---

#### 1. Prerequisites

* **CMake** ≥ 3.16
* A **C++17**-compatible compiler (e.g., `gcc`, `clang`)
* **make** or **ninja** build tool
* (Optional) **Docker**, for OpenWebUI integration

---

#### 2. Clone & Build

```bash
# Clone the Falcon-H1 llama.cpp fork
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp

# Create a build directory and compile
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..         # Configure the project
make -j$(nproc)  # Build the binaries
```

> Tip: For GPU acceleration, refer to the llama.cpp [GPU guide](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp#gpu-support).

---

#### 3. Download a GGUF Model

Fetch the desired Falcon-H1 checkpoint from Hugging Face’s collection:

```bash
# Example: download the 1B Instruct model
wget https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/Falcon-H1-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Falcon-H1-1.5B-Instruct-Q5_K.gguf \
     -P models/
```
